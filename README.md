#Reddit Clone Lab 

##Objective:
In this lab we will be using nested resources and what you've learned so far in class to create a multi-user app, similar to Reddit.

##Topics:

- Authentication
- Nested Resources

* Remember: when you add nested resources, you are making a promise. You're promising that whenever you use the route helpers, you will provide a resource in which they can be nested.

##Requirements:
* Users should be able to log in
* User can post with a link and body 
* Users can comment on posts (just a body)

* Views:
 - You should be able to see a list of the posts with comments
 - You should be able to see all the comments associated with a past
 - You should be able to navigate to a single comment

##Bonus
- Try to see if you can have nested comments, that is: have comments able to be commented upon
